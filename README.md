# mimic_missing_values

This is the code to accompany my final project for BIODS 220 Fall 2022. 
In this project, I access the performance of various supervised learning models for handling EHR data with missing values.
The scripts necessary to reproduce the results are in the `run_scripts/` directory.
The modules necessary to run the scripts can be found in `requirements.txt`, which can be imported in a virtual environment using
`pip install -r requirements.txt`. For a conda environment, first install pip in conda and then import the requirements using pip.
